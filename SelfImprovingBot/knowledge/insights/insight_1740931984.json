    "thinking": "You're right, Reto. The current implementation is quite token-heavy, which makes it inefficient for self-improvement. The main issue is that the entire codebase is stored in a single file and sent to Claude with each interaction, consuming a large portion of the token context window. Let's develop a plan to address this issue:\n\n## Current Issues:\n1. All code is in a single `main.py` file, making it large and unwieldy.\n2. The entire code is sent to Claude for every interaction.\n3. No documentation of the architecture that could be referenced instead of the full code.\n\n## Improvement Plan:\n\n### 1. Modularize the Codebase\nSplit the monolithic `main.py` into multiple files organized by functionality:\n- `config.py` - Configuration settings\n- `knowledge.py` - Knowledge base functionality\n- `research.py` - Research and learning manager\n- `conversation.py` - Conversation handling\n- `code_manager.py` - Code management\n- `progress.py` - Progress tracking\n- `commands.py` - Command processor\n- `ai",
    "user_input": "Your self improvement mechanism uses to many tokens. Implement a plan to improve that situation. E.g. make multiple code files and add Function calling to read them if needed. You could also consider documenting the architecture of the code and read it first when needed instead of reading the whole code.",
