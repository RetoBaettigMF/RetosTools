# Tool Calling Fix for Claude API

## Issue Description

The original implementation of the Claude API tool calling functionality had a limitation where it would stop after the first tool call instead of continuing to process additional tool calls until completion. This meant that for tasks requiring multiple steps, Claude would only complete the first step and then stop.

## Solution

The solution involved modifying the `_process_tool_calls` method in the `ClaudeAPI` class to recursively handle tool calls until Claude no longer requests any tools. The key changes were:

1. After processing the initial tool calls and sending a follow-up request to Claude, check if the follow-up response contains additional tool calls.
2. **Critically, ensure that the tools are included in the follow-up request** - without this, Claude can't make additional tool calls.
3. If there are additional tool calls, recursively process them by calling `_process_tool_calls` again with the new tool calls.
4. Combine the results of all recursive tool calls to maintain a complete record of all tools used.
5. Update the formatting in `main.py` to properly display all tool calls, including those from recursive calls.

## Files Modified

- `utils/claude_api.py`: Updated the `_process_tool_calls` method to recursively handle tool calls.
- `main.py`: Enhanced the `format_answer` method to better display all tool calls, including numbering and a total count.

## Testing

A test script has been created at `tests/test_recursive_tools.py` to verify that the recursive tool calling is working correctly. This script:

1. Initializes the Claude API
2. Creates a system prompt that encourages multiple tool calls
3. Sends a prompt that requires multiple tool calls to complete
4. Displays the results, including all tool calls made

To run the test:

```bash
python tests/test_recursive_tools.py
```

The test will pass if Claude makes multiple tool calls to complete the requested task.

## Expected Behavior

With these changes, Claude should now be able to:

1. Make an initial tool call
2. Process the result of that tool call
3. Make additional tool calls as needed
4. Continue this process until the task is complete
5. Return a comprehensive response that includes all tool calls made

This enables Claude to handle more complex, multi-step tasks that require multiple tool calls to complete.
